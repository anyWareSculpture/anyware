# anyWare Coding Standard

This document is intended to be used as a checklist for any
code developed as part of the anyWare project.

### All Code Should...

* Follow the [style guide](CODING_STYLE.md)
* Have valid, complete JSDoc comments on all *public* methods and events
* Have unit tests and code coverage greater than 90%
> While code coverage is important, it doesn't say anything about how good tests really are. To test your tests, try changing things in your code in the same ways you expect future people to and see if your tests break. Your tests should protect people from making silly mistakes and breaking any assumptions your code makes.
* Be code reviewed for clairty, readability, maintainability and style
